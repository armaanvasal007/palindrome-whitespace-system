Palindrome Checker in Whitespace - Human Readable Version

This program checks if a number is a palindrome.

ALGORITHM:
1. Read input number from stdin
2. Check if number is negative (if so, return 0)
3. Extract digits and build reversed number
4. Compare original with reversed number
5. Output 1 if equal (palindrome), 0 if not

WHITESPACE INSTRUCTION MAPPING:
Space Space Number = Push number to stack
Tab Line Feed Tab Space = Read number from input
Tab Line Feed Space Space = Output number to stdout
Line Feed Line Feed = End program

ACTUAL WHITESPACE CODE BREAKDOWN:
The palindrome.ws file contains:
- Input reading instructions
- Digit extraction and reversal logic  
- Comparison operations
- Output generation

EDGE CASES HANDLED:
- Single digit numbers (always palindrome)
- Negative numbers (never palindrome)
- Numbers with trailing zeros
- Invalid input (treated as non-palindrome)

EXECUTION FLOW:
Input → Whitespace Interpreter → Core Logic → Output (0 or 1)

The Whitespace program is executed by the backend server which:
1. Receives HTTP request with number
2. Passes number to Whitespace executor
3. Whitespace program processes the logic
4. Returns 1 (palindrome) or 0 (not palindrome)
5. Backend formats response as JSON

Note: Whitespace uses only spaces, tabs, and linefeeds as meaningful characters.
All other characters are ignored as comments.
